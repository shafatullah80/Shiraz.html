  <p><h3>in this article</h3>
     we will know the HTML Paragraph, & its basic<br>
     implementation <through the examples. The <p> tag in HTML defines <br>
        a paragraph. These have both opening and closing tags. So anything <br>
        mentioned within <p> and </p> is treated as a paragraph. Most browsers <br>
        read a line as a paragraph even if we donâ€™t use the closing tag i.e, </p>, <br>
        but this may raise unexpected results. So, it is a good convention,<br>
         and we must use the closing tag. </p>
